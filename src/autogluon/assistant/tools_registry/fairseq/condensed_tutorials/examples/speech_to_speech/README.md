# Condensed: Speech to speech translation (S2ST)

Summary: This tutorial provides implementations for three speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) approaches: Direct S2ST with Discrete Units, Textless S2ST on Real Data, and Enhanced Direct S2ST with pre-training and data augmentation. The code helps with building speech translation systems that convert speech from one language directly to speech in another language. Key functionalities include discrete unit-based translation, textless translation with real-world data, and enhanced techniques using self-supervised pre-training. Each implementation includes comprehensive documentation with code samples and configuration parameters for practical implementation.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

# Speech to Speech Translation (S2ST)

## Available Implementations

The repository provides implementations for three key S2ST approaches:

1. **Direct S2ST with Discrete Units** (Lee et al. 2021)
   - Implements direct speech-to-speech translation using discrete units
   - Documentation at `docs/direct_s2st_discrete_units.md`

2. **Textless S2ST on Real Data** (Lee et al. 2021)
   - Focuses on textless translation with real-world data
   - Documentation at `docs/textless_s2st_real_data.md`

3. **Enhanced Direct S2ST**
   - Features self-supervised pre-training and data augmentation techniques
   - Documentation at `docs/enhanced_direct_s2st_discrete_units.md`

Each implementation includes detailed documentation with code samples, configuration parameters, and implementation details in their respective documentation files.
