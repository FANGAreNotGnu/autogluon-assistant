# Condensed: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach

Summary: This tutorial demonstrates RoBERTa implementation in PyTorch, covering model loading, text encoding/decoding, and feature extraction techniques. It helps with classification tasks, batched prediction, mask filling, and pronoun disambiguation. Key functionalities include working with pre-trained models (base/large), extracting contextual embeddings, registering custom classification heads, and performing inference on GPU. The tutorial provides code examples for text processing, sentence pair classification, and word-aligned feature extraction, making it valuable for developers implementing transformer-based NLP solutions with RoBERTa's improved BERT architecture.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

# RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach

RoBERTa improves on BERT's pretraining by:
- Training longer with bigger batches over more data
- Removing next sentence prediction objective
- Training on longer sequences
- Dynamically changing masking patterns

## Pre-trained Models

```
roberta.base (125M params): BERT-base architecture
roberta.large (355M params): BERT-large architecture
roberta.large.mnli: Finetuned on MNLI
roberta.large.wsc: Finetuned on WSC
```

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Loading

```python
# PyTorch >= 1.1 with torch.hub
import torch
roberta = torch.hub.load('pytorch/fairseq', 'roberta.large')
roberta.eval()  # disable dropout

# For PyTorch 1.0 or custom models
from fairseq.models.roberta import RobertaModel
roberta = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('/path/to/roberta.large', checkpoint_file='model.pt')
roberta.eval()
```

### Text Processing and Feature Extraction

```python
# Apply BPE encoding
tokens = roberta.encode('Hello world!')
assert tokens.tolist() == [0, 31414, 232, 328, 2]
roberta.decode(tokens)  # 'Hello world!'

# Extract features
last_layer_features = roberta.extract_features(tokens)
assert last_layer_features.size() == torch.Size([1, 5, 1024])

# Get all layers' features
all_layers = roberta.extract_features(tokens, return_all_hiddens=True)
assert len(all_layers) == 25
```

### Classification Tasks

```python
# Load model finetuned for MNLI
roberta = torch.hub.load('pytorch/fairseq', 'roberta.large.mnli')
roberta.eval()

# Sentence pair classification
tokens = roberta.encode('Roberta is a heavily optimized version of BERT.', 
                        'Roberta is not very optimized.')
roberta.predict('mnli', tokens).argmax()  # 0: contradiction

# Register new classification head
roberta.register_classification_head('new_task', num_classes=3)
```

### Batched Prediction

```python
from fairseq.data.data_utils import collate_tokens

batch_of_pairs = [
    ['Roberta is a heavily optimized version of BERT.', 'Roberta is not very optimized.'],
    ['Roberta is a heavily optimized version of BERT.', 'Roberta is based on BERT.'],
    # more examples...
]

batch = collate_tokens(
    [roberta.encode(pair[0], pair[1]) for pair in batch_of_pairs], pad_idx=1
)

logprobs = roberta.predict('mnli', batch)
```

### Advanced Features

#### Mask Filling

```python
roberta.fill_mask('The first Star wars movie came out in <mask>', topk=3)
# [('The first Star wars movie came out in 1977', 0.95, ' 1977'), ...]
```

#### Pronoun Disambiguation (WSC)

```python
# Install dependencies
# pip install spacy
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

roberta = torch.hub.load('pytorch/fairseq', 'roberta.large.wsc', user_dir='examples/roberta/wsc')

# The pronoun [it] refers to trophy or suitcase?
roberta.disambiguate_pronoun('The _trophy_ would not fit in the brown suitcase because [it] was too big.')  # True
```

#### Word-Aligned Features

```python
doc = roberta.extract_features_aligned_to_words('I said, "hello RoBERTa."')
for tok in doc:
    print(f'{str(tok):10}{tok.vector[:5]}')
```

## Finetuning and Pretraining

- Finetuning available for GLUE, custom classification tasks, WSC, and Commonsense QA
- Pretraining on custom data supported (see documentation)

## GPU Usage

```python
roberta.cuda()  # Move model to GPU
```

## Best Practices

- For evaluation, use `model.eval()` to disable dropout
- For finetuning, keep model in training mode
- When working with multiple sentences, use batched prediction for efficiency
- For custom tasks, register a new classification head
