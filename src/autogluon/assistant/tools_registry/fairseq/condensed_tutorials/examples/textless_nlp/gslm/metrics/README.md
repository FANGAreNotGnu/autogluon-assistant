# Condensed: GSLM Metrics

Summary: This tutorial covers implementation of speech evaluation metrics for generative spoken language models. It details ASR metrics using word error rate from transcribed speech, ABX metrics for evaluating phonetic category discrimination in quantized representations, and scoring-based metrics (sWUGGY and sBLIMP) from the ZeroSpeech challenge for assessing linguistic properties of speech representations. The tutorial helps with implementing speech quality evaluation, phonetic discrimination testing, and linguistic property assessment of speech models, providing specific techniques for comprehensive speech synthesis evaluation following established benchmarks.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

# GSLM Metrics

## ASR Metrics
Uses an ASR model to transcribe synthesized speech, then applies text-based metrics:
- Word Error Rate (WER) from ASR transcription serves as a primary metric
- [More details available in ASR metrics documentation](asr_metrics)

## ABX Metrics
Evaluates phonetic category separation in quantized representations:
- Implements [ABX discriminability measures](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ABX-Discriminability-Measures-and-Applications-Schatz/13d3537228f728c1063cc83743cb118bba3367a0)
- [Implementation details in ABX metrics documentation](abx_metrics)

## sWUGGY and sBLIMP
Scoring-based metrics from the ZeroSpeech challenge:
- Evaluates linguistic properties of speech representations
