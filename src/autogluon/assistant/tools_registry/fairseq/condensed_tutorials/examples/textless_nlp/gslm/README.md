# Condensed: Generative Spoken Language Modeling

Summary: This tutorial implements a generative speech2speech system using discrete speech units as described in academic research. It covers three key components: Speech2Unit (converting raw speech to discrete units using various feature extractors), Unit Language Model (a transformer-based generative model for discrete speech units), and Unit2Speech (synthesizing speech from units). The code demonstrates how to extract features, quantize them, configure transformer models, and generate audio. The tutorial helps with speech processing tasks including speech quantization, language modeling on discrete units, and speech synthesis, with practical tools for resynthesizing existing utterances and generating novel spoken language.

# Generative Spoken Language Modeling

## Overview
Implementation of a generative speech2speech system using discrete speech units, as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01192).

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Speech2Unit**: Quantizes raw speech into discrete units
2. **Unit Language Model (ULM)**: Generative model trained on discrete speech units
3. **Unit2Speech**: Synthesizes speech from discrete units

## Architecture Components

### Speech2Unit
Converts raw speech into discrete units using one of several feature extractors:
- Log Mel Filterbank
- Modified CPC
- HuBERT Base
- Wav2Vec 2.0 Large

```python
# Example usage pattern (simplified)
model = load_feature_extractor(model_type)  # model_type: 'hubert', 'w2v2', etc.
features = model.extract_features(audio)
units = quantize_features(features, kmeans_model)
```

### Unit Language Model (ULM)
Generative model trained on the discrete speech units, typically using transformer-based architectures.

```python
# Training configuration example
config = {
    "model_type": "transformer",
    "vocab_size": 100,  # Number of discrete units
    "hidden_size": 768,
    "num_layers": 12,
    "attention_heads": 12,
    "max_seq_len": 2048
}
```

### Unit2Speech
Synthesizes speech from discrete units, typically using a vocoder or similar model.

```python
# Synthesis example
synthesizer = load_unit2speech_model(checkpoint_path)
audio = synthesizer.generate(units, conditioning_info)
```

## Metrics
The system can be evaluated using:
- ASR-based metrics
- Zero-shot metrics (as proposed in the paper)

## Tools
Two practical tools are provided:
1. Resynthesizer for existing spoken utterances
2. Generator for novel spoken language from a prompt

## Best Practices
- Use appropriate sampling rates (typically 16kHz)
- Pre-process audio to remove silence and normalize volume
- When training ULM, ensure sufficient context length for capturing long-range dependencies
- For high-quality synthesis, consider fine-tuning the Unit2Speech model on target domain
