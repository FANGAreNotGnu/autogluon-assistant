# Condensed: GSLM Tools

Summary: This tutorial explains how to use the GSLM Tools for speech resynthesis, implementing the unsupervised method from the referenced paper. It helps with audio processing tasks where input audio needs to be resynthesized into output audio. The tutorial covers command-line implementation with key parameters including feature type selection (logmel/cpc/hubert/w2v2), acoustic model configuration, kmeans model integration, unit2speech model usage, and waveglow vocoder implementation. Developers can use this for speech synthesis applications by understanding the parameter configuration and execution flow of the resynthesis pipeline.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

# GSLM Tools - Resynthesis

## Implementation Details

The resynthesis tool implements the unsupervised method described in the paper, allowing you to input audio and get resynthesized output.

## Command Line Usage

```bash
PYTHONPATH=${FAIRSEQ_ROOT}:${FAIRSEQ_ROOT}/examples/textless_nlp/gslm/unit2speech python ${FAIRSEQ_ROOT}/examples/textless_nlp/gslm/tools/resynthesize_speech.py \
    --feature_type $TYPE \
    --acoustic_model_path $ACOUSTIC_MODEL_PATH \
    --layer $LAYER \
    --kmeans_model_path $KM_MODEL_PATH \
    --tts_model_path $TTS_MODEL_PATH \
    --code_dict_path $CODE_DICT_PATH \
    --waveglow_path $WAVEGLOW_PATH \
    --max_decoder_steps 2000
```
