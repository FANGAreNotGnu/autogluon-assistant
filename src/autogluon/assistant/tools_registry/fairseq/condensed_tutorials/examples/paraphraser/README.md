# Condensed: Paraphrasing with round-trip translation and mixture of experts

Summary: This tutorial demonstrates implementing text paraphrasing using round-trip translation (English → French → English) with a mixture of experts model. It covers setting up fairseq, downloading pre-trained translation models, and running the paraphraser to generate diverse sentence variations. Key functionalities include leveraging mixture of experts for generating multiple paraphrase alternatives while preserving original meaning, installation of required dependencies, and executing the paraphrasing pipeline. The implementation produces varied sentence structures and word choices for the same input text, making it useful for text augmentation and rewriting tasks.

# Paraphrasing with Round-Trip Translation and Mixture of Experts

This implementation uses machine translation models to paraphrase text through round-trip translation (English → French → English), leveraging a mixture of experts translation model.

## Setup and Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq.git
cd fairseq
pip install --editable .
pip install sacremoses sentencepiece
```

## Download Required Models

```bash
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fairseq/models/paraphraser.en-fr.tar.gz
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fairseq/models/paraphraser.fr-en.hMoEup.tar.gz
tar -xzvf paraphraser.en-fr.tar.gz
tar -xzvf paraphraser.fr-en.hMoEup.tar.gz
```

## Running the Paraphraser

```bash
python examples/paraphraser/paraphrase.py \
    --en2fr paraphraser.en-fr \
    --fr2en paraphraser.fr-en.hMoEup
```

The implementation generates multiple paraphrased versions of the input text by leveraging the mixture of experts model, which produces diverse translations from French back to English.

### Example Input/Output

**Input:**
```
The new date for the Games, postponed for a year in response to the coronavirus pandemic, gives athletes time to recalibrate their training schedules.
```

**Sample Outputs:**
- "Delayed one year in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the new date of the Games gives athletes time to rebalance their training schedule."
- "The new date of the Games, which was rescheduled one year in response to the coronavirus (CV) pandemic, gives athletes time to rebalance their training schedule."
- "The Games' new date, postponed one year in response to the coronavirus pandemic, gives athletes time to rebalance their training schedule."

The mixture of experts approach produces varied paraphrases with different sentence structures while preserving the original meaning.
