# Condensed: XGLM multilingual model

Summary: This tutorial introduces XGLM, a multilingual autoregressive language model family (564M-7.5B parameters) for cross-lingual NLP tasks. It provides implementation knowledge for leveraging XGLM's zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities across 134 languages using natural language descriptions. The tutorial helps with coding tasks involving cross-lingual transfer, knowledge probing, and translation. Key features include working with the CC100-XL dataset, evaluating model performance on benchmarks like XNLI and FLORES-101, and understanding responsible AI considerations such as bias assessment and hate speech detection limitations. The model is primarily designed for research purposes rather than general language generation.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

# XGLM Multilingual Model

## Overview
XGLM is a family of multilingual autoregressive language models (564M to 7.5B parameters) developed by FAIR for research purposes. The models are trained on a balanced corpus of diverse languages (CC100-XL dataset) and can learn tasks from natural language descriptions with few examples.

## Key Capabilities
- Zero-shot and few-shot learning across languages
- Cross-lingual transfer through templates and examples
- Knowledge probing in different languages
- Translation capabilities

## Evaluation Metrics
The model was evaluated on:
1. Cross-lingual tasks: XNLI, XStoryCloze, XCOPA, XWinograd, PAWS-X
2. Responsible AI tasks: Hate speech detection, occupation identification (bias assessment)
3. Knowledge probing: mLAMA benchmark
4. Translation: WMT benchmarks and FLORES-101

## Training Data
The model uses CC100-XL, an extended version of CC100 covering:
- 68 Common Crawl snapshots (Summer 2013 to March/April 2020)
- 134 languages
- Significantly larger than previous multilingual datasets

## Responsible AI Findings
- **Hate Speech Detection**: Performance only slightly better than random (50%) across 5 languages
- **Bias**: XGLM 7.5B showed less bias on occupation identification compared to other models
- **Efficiency**: Single unified multilingual model reduces carbon footprint compared to separate models for different languages

## Limitations
- Few-shot results sometimes worse than zero-shot for hate speech detection
- Primary purpose is not language generation
- Intended for research purposes only
