Summary: This tutorial provides implementations for three speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) approaches: Direct S2ST with Discrete Units, Textless S2ST on Real Data, and Enhanced Direct S2ST with pre-training and data augmentation. The code helps with building speech translation systems that convert speech from one language directly to speech in another language. Key functionalities include discrete unit-based translation, textless translation with real-world data, and enhanced techniques using self-supervised pre-training. Each implementation includes comprehensive documentation with code samples and configuration parameters for practical implementation.
