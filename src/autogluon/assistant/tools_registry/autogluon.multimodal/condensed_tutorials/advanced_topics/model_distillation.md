# Condensed: ```python

Summary: This tutorial demonstrates knowledge distillation in AutoGluon MultiModal, showing how to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model. It covers implementation techniques for loading pre-trained models, configuring distillation, and evaluating performance. The code helps with creating efficient, smaller models that maintain accuracy by learning from larger ones. Key features include: simple distillation activation via the teacher_predictor parameter, working with BERT models of different sizes (12-layer to 6-layer), dataset preparation for NLP tasks, and model evaluation. The implementation focuses on practical application with minimal configuration requirements.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

# Knowledge Distillation in AutoGluon MultiModal

## Setup and Data Preparation
```python
# Install required packages
!pip install autogluon.multimodal

# Load and prepare dataset
import datasets
from datasets import load_dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

dataset = load_dataset("glue", "qnli")
train_valid_df = dataset["train"].to_pandas()[["question", "sentence", "label"]].sample(1000, random_state=123)
train_df, valid_df = train_test_split(train_valid_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
test_df = dataset["validation"].to_pandas()[["question", "sentence", "label"]].sample(1000, random_state=123)
```

## Loading the Teacher Model
```python
# Download pre-trained teacher model
!wget --quiet https://automl-mm-bench.s3.amazonaws.com/unit-tests/distillation_sample_teacher.zip -O distillation_sample_teacher.zip
!unzip -q -o distillation_sample_teacher.zip -d .

# Load the teacher model
from autogluon.multimodal import MultiModalPredictor
teacher_predictor = MultiModalPredictor.load("ag_distillation_sample_teacher/")
```

## Distilling Knowledge to Student Model
```python
# Create and train student model with knowledge distillation
student_predictor = MultiModalPredictor(label="label")
student_predictor.fit(
    train_df,
    tuning_data=valid_df,
    teacher_predictor=teacher_predictor,
    hyperparameters={
        "model.hf_text.checkpoint_name": "google/bert_uncased_L-6_H-768_A-12",
        "optim.max_epochs": 2,
    }
)

# Evaluate the student model
print(student_predictor.evaluate(data=test_df))
```

## Key Implementation Details
- The teacher model uses the full BERT model (`google/bert_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12`)
- The student model uses a smaller BERT model (`google/bert_uncased_L-6_H-768_A-12`) with half the layers
- Knowledge distillation is activated by simply passing the `teacher_predictor` parameter to the fit method
- The student model learns by matching predictions/feature maps from the teacher
